# Review

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS (the PRD this work was built against, if available)

Runs after `/implement`. Checks what was actually written, fixes what's wrong, then opens the PR.

Nothing here is advisory. If you find a problem, fix it and re-run the checks.

## Process

1. **Find what changed.** The agent may have committed, or left everything in the working tree, or both. Check all of it:

   ```bash
   git status --porcelain          # uncommitted edits + untracked files
   git branch --show-current
   git diff $(git merge-base HEAD {base})...HEAD --stat   # committed on this branch
   git diff --stat                 # unstaged
   git diff --cached --stat        # staged
   ```

   Untracked files are the ones that get missed — `git diff` doesn't show them, so a new file the agent wrote goes unreviewed. Take the union of all of the above.

   Read the changed code, not the whole repo — pre-existing issues are out of scope unless they're Critical or the change made them reachable.

   Read the PRD if given. Its Definition of Done, functional requirements (acceptance criteria), and security table are the checklist; anything listed there and missing is a finding. If the implementation left a report or plan listing files it touched, diff that list against what git actually shows — files claimed but unchanged, or changed but unclaimed, are both worth knowing about.

2. **Static checks.** Find the real commands (`package.json` scripts, `Makefile`, CI config) — don't assume a toolchain. Run lint, type check, and tests, capturing each.

3. **Performance pass.** Read the changed logic for work that doesn't need doing:
   - Queries inside loops, or a loop that could be one query — N+1 is the most common one and the most expensive
   - Repeated computation that could be hoisted, memoized, or done once
   - Nested iteration over the same data where a map or set gives you a lookup
   - Loading whole collections to count, filter, or take the first item
   - Sync I/O, or sequential awaits over independent work
   - Unbounded growth: no pagination, no limit, no cleanup

   Judge against expected data size, not aesthetics. A nested loop over 5 config entries is fine; the same shape over user records is not.

4. **OWASP 2025 pass.** Walk all ten against the diff — one at a time, no skipping.

   | # | Category |
   |---|---|
   | A01 | Broken Access Control |
   | A02 | Security Misconfiguration |
   | A03 | Software Supply Chain Failures |
   | A04 | Cryptographic Failures |
   | A05 | Injection |
   | A06 | Insecure Design |
   | A07 | Authentication Failures |
   | A08 | Software or Data Integrity Failures |
   | A09 | Security Logging and Alerting Failures |
   | A10 | Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions |

   Two questions per category: did this code introduce a weakness, and did it weaken an existing control — by widening a query, reusing a permissive handler, loosening validation, or logging a field that wasn't logged before. Logic flaws count: an auth check that runs after the mutation, a limit enforced client-side only, an ownership check on the wrong ID.

   New dependencies get checked for known CVEs and for whether they were needed at all.

5. **Fix and re-run.** Fix everything Critical and High, plus anything that fails a static check. After *any* code change, re-run lint, types, and tests — a performance rewrite is exactly the kind of change that breaks an edge case silently.

   Loop until clean. Leave Medium and Low as findings if the fix is a design decision rather than a correction.

6. **Open the PR** — only if everything above passes. See below.

## PR

Target the `development` branch.

If it doesn't exist, or there's no remote, or the repo was just initialized: stop and set it up with the user. Confirm the target branch name (`development`, `develop`, `main`), whether a remote exists and where, and whether they want the branch created now. Don't invent a branching model or push to a remote they didn't name.

```bash
gh pr create --base development --title "{what changed}" --body "{summary}"
```

Body: what changed and why, the validation results table, any Medium/Low findings left open, anything the reviewer should look at closely.

## Review

| Check | Result | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Lint | ✅/❌ | {n errors or "passed"} |
| Types | ✅/❌ | {n errors or "passed"} |
| Tests | ✅/❌ | {n passed, m failed} |
| Performance | ✅/⚠️ | {n issues, k fixed} |
| Security | ✅/⚠️/❌ | {critical/high/medium/low counts} |
| PRD DoD | ✅/❌ | {n of m met} |

### Fixed
- `{file:line}` — {what was wrong, what changed}

### Findings
**[SEVERITY] {title}** · `{file:line}`
{What's wrong, what it risks, and the fix.}

### Verdict
{PASS / PASS WITH NOTES / FAIL}

### PR
{link, or why one wasn't opened}
```

Severity: **Critical** exploitable now · **High** real weakness · **Medium** defense-in-depth · **Low** best practice.

## Rules

- Every OWASP row gets answered. "No" is an answer; silence isn't.
- Any code change means re-running lint, types, and tests. No exceptions.
- Critical or High open means FAIL and no PR.
- Don't flag style. Flag correctness, security, and work that measurably doesn't need doing.
- Don't create branches or remotes on your own — that's a conversation with the user.
